Run to the right is a web-based game in which you have to run as far as possible while skillfully evading bombs and engaging airborne eye monsters alongside skeletal allies. Developed with [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) and coded in Typescript. This game was initiated using [Phaser 3 TypeScript Starter](https://github.com/geocine/phaser3-rollup-typescript) for a robust foundation.

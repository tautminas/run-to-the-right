/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Bitmap Mask combines the alpha (opacity) of a masked pixel with the alpha of another pixel.
 * Unlike the Geometry Mask, which is a clipping path, a Bitmap Mask behaves like an alpha mask,
 * not a clipping path. It is only available when using the WebGL Renderer.
 *
 * A Bitmap Mask can use any Game Object or Dynamic Texture to determine the alpha of each pixel of the masked Game Object(s).
 * For any given point of a masked Game Object's texture, the pixel's alpha will be multiplied by the alpha
 * of the pixel at the same position in the Bitmap Mask's Game Object. The color of the pixel from the
 * Bitmap Mask doesn't matter.
 *
 * For example, if a pure blue pixel with an alpha of 0.95 is masked with a pure red pixel with an
 * alpha of 0.5, the resulting pixel will be pure blue with an alpha of 0.475. Naturally, this means
 * that a pixel in the mask with an alpha of 0 will hide the corresponding pixel in all masked Game Objects.
 * A pixel with an alpha of 1 in the masked Game Object will receive the same alpha as the
 * corresponding pixel in the mask.
 *
 * Note: You cannot combine Bitmap Masks and Blend Modes on the same Game Object. You can, however,
 * combine Geometry Masks and Blend Modes together.
 *
 * The Bitmap Mask's location matches the location of its Game Object, not the location of the
 * masked objects. Moving or transforming the underlying Game Object will change the mask
 * (and affect the visibility of any masked objects), whereas moving or transforming a masked object
 * will not affect the mask.
 *
 * The Bitmap Mask will not render its Game Object by itself. If the Game Object is not in a
 * Scene's display list, it will only be used for the mask and its full texture will not be directly
 * visible. Adding the underlying Game Object to a Scene will not cause any problems - it will
 * render as a normal Game Object and will also serve as a mask.
 *

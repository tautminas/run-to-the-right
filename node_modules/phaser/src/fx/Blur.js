/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Blur FX Controller.
 *
 * This FX controller manages the blur effect for a Game Object.
 *
 * A Gaussian blur is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect,
 * typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a
 * smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different
 * from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination.
 *
 * A Blur effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
 *
 * ```js
 * const sprite = this.add.sprite();
 *
 * sprite.preFX.addBlur();
 * sprite.postFX.addBlur();
 * ```
 *
 * @class Blur
 * @extends Phaser.FX.Controller
 * @memberof Phaser.FX
 * @constructor
 * @since 3.60.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject} gameObject - A reference to the Game Object that has this fx.
 * @param {number} [quality=0] - The quality of the blur effect. Can be either 0 for Low Quality, 1 for Medium Quality or 2 for High Quality.
 * @param {number} [x=2] - The horizontal offset of the blur effect.
 * @param {number} [y=2] - The vertical offset of the blur effect.
 * @param {number} [strength=1] - The strength of the blur effect.
 * @param {number} [color=0xffffff] - The color of the blur, as a hex value.
 * @param {number} [steps=4] - The number of steps to run the blur effect for. This value should always be an integer.

/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Gradient FX Controller.
 *
 * This FX controller manages the gradient effect for a Game Object.
 *
 * The gradient overlay effect is a visual technique where a smooth color transition is applied over Game Objects,
 * such as sprites or UI components. This effect is used to enhance visual appeal, emphasize depth, or create
 * stylistic and atmospheric variations. It can also be utilized to convey information, such as representing
 * progress or health status through color changes.
 *
 * A Gradient effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
 *
 * ```js
 * const sprite = this.add.sprite();
 *
 * sprite.preFX.addGradient();
 * sprite.postFX.addGradient();
 * ```
 *
 * @class Gradient
 * @extends Phaser.FX.Controller
 * @memberof Phaser.FX
 * @constructor
 * @since 3.60.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject} gameObject - A reference to the Game Object that has this fx.
 * @param {number} [color1=0xff0000] - The first gradient color, given as a number value.
 * @param {number} [color2=0x00ff00] - The second gradient color, given as a number value.
 * @param {number} [alpha=0.2] - The alpha value of the gradient effect.
 * @param {number} [fromX=0] - The horizontal position the gradient will start from. This value is normalized, between 0 and 1, and is not in pixels.
 * @param {number} [fromY=0] - The vertical position the gradient will start from. This value is normalized, between 0 and 1, and is not in pixels.
 * @param {number} [toX=0] - The horizontal position the gradient will end at. This value is normalized, between 0 and 1, and is not in pixels.
 * @param {number} [toY=1] - The vertical position the gradient will end at. This value is normalized, between 0 and 1, and is not in pixels.
 * @param {number} [size=0] - How many 'chunks' the gradient is divided in to, as spread over the entire height of the texture. Leave this at zero for a smooth gradient, or set higher for a more retro chunky effect.

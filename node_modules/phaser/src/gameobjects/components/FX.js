/**
 * @classdesc
 * The FX Component features a set of methods used for applying a range of special built-in effects to a Game Object.
 *
 * The effects include the following:
 *
 * * Barrel Distortion
 * * Bloom
 * * Blur
 * * Bokeh / Tilt Shift
 * * Circle Outline
 * * Color Matrix
 * * Glow
 * * Displacement
 * * Gradient
 * * Pixelate
 * * Shine
 * * Shadow
 * * Vignette
 * * Wipe / Reveal
 *
 * All Game Objects support Post FX. These are effects applied after the Game Object has been rendered.
 *
 * Texture-based Game Objects also support Pre FX, including:
 *
 * * Image
 * * Sprite
 * * TileSprite
 * * Text
 * * RenderTexture
 * * Video
 *
 * And any Game Object that extends the above.
 *
 * The difference between Pre FX and Post FX are that all Post FX take place in a canvas (renderer) sized frame buffer,
 * after the Game Object has been rendered. Pre FX, however, take place in a texture sized frame buffer, which is sized
 * based on the Game Object itself. The end result is then composited back to the main game canvas. For intensive effects,
 * such as blur, bloom or glow, which can require many iterations, this is a much more efficient way to apply the effect,
 * as only it only has to work on a Game Object sized texture and not all pixels in the canvas.
 *
 * In short, you should always try and use a Pre FX if you can.
 *
 * Due to the way that FX work they can be stacked-up. For example, you can apply a blur to a Game Object, then apply
 * a bloom effect to the same Game Object. The bloom effect will be applied to the blurred texture, not the original.
 * Keep the order in mind when stacking effects.
 *
 * All effects are WebGL only and do not have canvas counterparts.
 *
 * As you can appreciate, some effects are more expensive than others. For example, a bloom effect is going to be more
 * expensive than a simple color matrix effect, so please consider using them wisely and performance test your target
 * platforms early on in production.
 *
 * This component is created automatically by the `PostPipeline` class and does not need to be instantiated directly.

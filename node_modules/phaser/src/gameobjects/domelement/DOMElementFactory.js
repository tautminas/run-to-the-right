/**
 * DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
 *
 * In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
 * configuration object:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * dom {
 *   createContainer: true
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
 * of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
 * settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
 *
 * You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
 * Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');
 * ```
 *
 * The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
 * the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
 * it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
 *
 * You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
 * alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
 *
 * Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the
 * cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other
 * methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
 *
 * Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
 * position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
 * at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
 * they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
 * a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
 *
 * They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event
 * listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
 * entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
 * change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
 *
 * Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
 *
 * DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
 * a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
 * Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
 * UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
 * of your game, and should treat it accordingly.
 *
 * Note: This method will only be available if the DOM Element Game Object has been built into Phaser.
 *
 * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#dom
 * @since 3.17.0
 *
 * @param {number} x - The horizontal position of this DOM Element in the world.
 * @param {number} y - The vertical position of this DOM Element in the world.
 * @param {(HTMLElement|string)} [element] - An existing DOM element, or a string. If a string starting with a # it will do a `getElementById` look-up on the string (minus the hash). Without a hash, it represents the type of element to create, i.e. 'div'.
 * @param {(string|any)} [style] - If a string, will be set directly as the elements `style` property value. If a plain object, will be iterated and the values transferred. In both cases the values replacing whatever CSS styles may have been previously set.
 * @param {string} [innerText] - If given, will be set directly as the elements `innerText` property value, replacing whatever was there before.
 *
 * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement} The Game Object that was created.

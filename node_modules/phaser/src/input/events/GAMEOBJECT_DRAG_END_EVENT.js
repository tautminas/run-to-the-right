/**
 * The Game Object Drag End Event.
 *
 * This event is dispatched by an interactive Game Object if a pointer stops dragging it.
 *
 * Listen to this event from a Game Object using: `gameObject.on('dragend', listener)`.
 * Note that the scope of the listener is automatically set to be the Game Object instance itself.
 *
 * To receive this event, the Game Object must have been set as interactive and enabled for drag.
 * See [GameObject.setInteractive](Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#setInteractive) for more details.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Input.Events#GAMEOBJECT_DRAG_END

 * @param {number} dragX - The x coordinate where the Pointer stopped dragging the Game Object, in world space.

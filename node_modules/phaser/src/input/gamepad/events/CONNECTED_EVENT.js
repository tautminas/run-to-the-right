/**
 * The Gamepad Connected Event.
 *
 * This event is dispatched by the Gamepad Plugin when a Gamepad has been connected.
 *
 * Listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.input.gamepad.once('connected', listener)`.
 *
 * Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,
 * this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the
 * 'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads
 * already connected.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#CONNECTED
 * @type {string}
 * @since 3.0.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Input.Gamepad} pad - A reference to the Gamepad which was connected.
 * @param {Event} event - The native DOM Event that triggered the connection.

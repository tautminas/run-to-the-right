 * The Matter Physics Drag Event.

 * This event is dispatched by a Matter Physics World instance when a Pointer Constraint

 *
 * Listen to it from a Scene using: `this.matter.world.on('drag', listener)`.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Physics.Matter.Events#DRAG
 * @type {string}
 * @since 3.16.2
 *
 * @param {MatterJS.BodyType} body - The Body that is being dragged. This is a Matter Body, not a Phaser Game Object.
 * @param {Phaser.Physics.Matter.PointerConstraint} constraint - The Pointer Constraint that is dragging the body.

/**
 * The Process Queue Add Event.
 *
 * This event is dispatched by a Process Queue when a new item is successfully moved to its active list.
 *
 * You will most commonly see this used by a Scene's Update List when a new Game Object has been added.
 *
 * In that instance, listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.sys.updateList.on('add', listener)`.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Structs.Events#PROCESS_QUEUE_ADD
 * @type {string}
 * @since 3.20.0

/**
 * The Process Queue Remove Event.
 *
 * This event is dispatched by a Process Queue when a new item is successfully removed from its active list.

 * You will most commonly see this used by a Scene's Update List when a Game Object has been removed.
 *
 * In that instance, listen to this event from within a Scene using: `this.sys.updateList.on('remove', listener)`.
 *
 * @event Phaser.Structs.Events#PROCESS_QUEUE_REMOVE
